Sushi-Go-Round bot


This is a bot for the flash game Sushi-Go-Round I wrote some months ago and
never got around to finish. It plays mostly successfully the first few levels,
but it breaks after the 3rd or 4th. I got kind of bored with it after I made
it run well.

- Could use some threading.
- Has to have recipes and the bitmap ID for different foods.
- Only tested on Windows. Might make your Mac catch on fire. lol/jk
